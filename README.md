# PasswordLeakedChecker
It uses the FBI & CBI database and tells which passwords were leaked and how many times and just to make the transfer of the password fully safe we use encription and send only the first five digits of the encripted text out of about 20 letters and match your password with all the password we recieve which has been breached a number of times.
